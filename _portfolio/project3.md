The final goal of this research project is to develop an exploration system for monitoring unknown palm tree orchard environments while avoiding collisions and figuring out appearances of trees. I developed the whole system including pointcloud data processing, path planning, and controller. A state‑of‑the‑art open‑sourced SLAM algorithm is utilized. <br> **The code and implementation details are confidential for this project.**
